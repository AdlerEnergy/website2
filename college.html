        <h2>Future Plans</h2>
        <p>Currently I want to work with my dad during the summer. But to do that I would have to get certified for Welding. So he has been teaching me on the weekends basic contruction knowledge.
            Then once I start senior year, I plan to work at a fast food place such as Chipotle. I plan for senior year to only have 4 classes and leave early to work at my job. Then once I graduate I plan to help out
            volunteer construction sites for my religion and help rebuild for those affected by natural disasters. Thats all of my future plans.
